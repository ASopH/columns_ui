## Updates

### 26 December 2015

There has been further restructure of all the repos with more stuff moved to submodules. The instructions below about cloning/updating clones still apply.

### 29 November 2015

Some libraries have been moved to the [foobar2000-common](https://github.com/msquared2/foobar2000-common) repository and added to this repository as a submodule. 

Use `--recursive` when cloning this repository to clone foobar2000-common at the same time.

For an existing clone, use `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.
